        <h2>Educational Background</h2>
        
        <p>I finished my K.C.S.E in 2015 and attained a mean grade of A-.<br>
        I was called to join JKUAT, Nairobi where i was to partake in Mining Engineering .<br>
        I did that for 2 years and decided mining was not for me.<br>
        I decided to enroll to Moringa School to pursue my dream of becoming a <strong>software developer</strong> specializing in app development.
